I tried several methods of determining the best move for the computer before
I finally selected this one.  Each of my earlier methods worked fine to a point,
but then broke down into too many edge cases to be really workable.  This implimentation
uses a heuristic method to determine the best play, looking ahead two moves (the
computer's move and one player's move).  It is based on C code found at:

    https://kartikkukreja.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/heuristic-function-for-tic-tac-toe/

The author claims that this is unbeatable, and it may be.  I was unable to beat it,
myself, but I was able to play it to a draw more often than I should have.  This
was due to the fact that the strict heuristics had the computer move in the center
if it went first, instead of taking a corner.  This left four out of eight moves for the
human that could then be played to a draw.  By putting in a check for the first move and
then playing in an of the four corners if so, it reduces the human's moves which allow
playing to a draw from four to only one, thus incresing the computer's chance of a win
instead of only a draw.
